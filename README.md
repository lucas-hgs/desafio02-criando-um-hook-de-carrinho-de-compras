These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### How to clone the project:

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

First you have to run a git clone cli to clone the project: 

```
git clone https://github.com/lucas-hgs/desafio02-criando-um-hook-de-carrinho-de-compras
```

After that, you have install all the modules that is necessary to run the project.

If you're using Yarn:

```
yarn
```

In case if you're using npm, please use:

```
npm install
```

After installing all the modules necessary to run the application, you'll need to use 2 specific commands to run this application.

The first one is responsible to run a local server, that way you can use the API to fetch the movies inside of the application:

```
yarn server
```

The second one is to run the application as a development environment:

```
yarn start
```

Note:
>You have to run these commands on the Terminal

Please, let me know if you have any question.
